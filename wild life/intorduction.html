                <p>
                    Located in south-west Sri Lanka, Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest.
                    More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. There is much endemic wildlife, especially birds,
                    but the reserve is also home to over 50% of Sri Lanka's endemic species of
                    mammals and butterflies, as well as many kinds of insects, reptiles and rare amphibians.

                <p>
                    Horton Plains is a beautiful, stark world with excellent hikes in the shadows of Sri Lanka’s
                    second- and third-highest mountains, Kirigalpotta (2395m) and Totapola (2357m). The ‘plains’ form an undulating plateau over 2000m high,
                    covered by wild grasslands and interspersed with patches of thick forest, rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls and misty lakes. The surprising
                    diversity of the landscape is matched by the wide variety of wildlife,
                    although many of the larger animals are very elusive. Birdwatchers will be well rewarded.

Minneriya National Park is located in Sri Lanka’s North Central Province, 182 kilometers from Colombo. 
The major cities closest to Minneriya National Park are Habarana and Polonnaruwa.

The renovated, vast ancient Minneriya Rainwater Reservoir that irrigates a considerable area of the district 
of Polonnaruwa is the focal point of the Minneriya National Park.

Minneriya National Park, which is part of the elephant corridor that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National 
Parks, provides visitors with the opportunity to see elephant herds all year. May to October is the best period to visit
 Minneriya National Park in view of the world-famous Great Elephant Gathering of the Asian wild elephants.

                    development activities clear forests and disrupt their ancient migratory routes.</td>
